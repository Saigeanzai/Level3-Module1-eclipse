	 * the times during the week that are in BOTH people's schedules. The Schedule
	 * class is included in this package.
	 * 
	 * Example: person1 availability - Monday at 9, Tuesday at 14, and Friday 10
	 * person2 availability - Tuesday at 14, Friday 8, and Monday at 9 The returned
	 * HashMap should contain: Tuesday 14 and Monday 9
	 * 
	 * The returned Schedule object represents the times both people are available
	 * for a meeting.
	 * 
	 * Time availability is always at the top of the hour, so 9:30 is not valid Time
	 * availability always represents 1 hour Assume both schedules are in the same
	 * time zones
